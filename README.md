What is the Piscine? 🏊‍♂️

The 42 Piscine is an intense coding boot camp hosted by 42, a network of innovative coding schools. Just like diving into a swimming pool, the Piscine immerses participants in a challenging, hands-on coding experience. It's a chance for individuals to showcase their coding prowess and gain admission to the full-time curriculum at 42.


###My Piscine Experience 🎉

I participated in the Piscine at 42 Porto, a challenging 26-day program. During this time, I dedicated myself to coding challenges, collaborated with peers, and honed my programming skills.

###Repository Structure 📂

This repository contains my solutions to exercises from the 42 Piscine, organized into folders corresponding to different topics or assignments. Each exercise includes my code, along with any additional resources or instructions necessary for completion.

Feel free to explore, learn, and engage with the exercises. Remember, the Piscine is a demanding but rewarding experience, and with dedication and perseverance, you can enhance your programming skills and achieve your goals.

Happy coding! 💻✨
